// The one parser of every subcommand's command line. A subcommand declares its flags and how many arguments it
// takes; one that runs requests also takes every option of the C API's vocabulary as a flag of its name in kebab-case,
// read by the option's type, so that an option the library adds is a flag without the parser changing. A subcommand
// that holds a model of each task also takes each option after the name of a task's subcommand and a dot, as
// --asr.language, for the model of that task alone. A flag's value
// follows it or an "=" ("--seed 7", "--seed=7"), but for a boolean option, which is true alone and takes "=true" or
// "=false" ("--do-sample=false"); "--" ends the flags, so that an argument may begin with "-".
