"""Checks the `speech` command line against the worker, whose protocol worker_smoke.py and worker_recognition_smoke.py
check, and checks what every subcommand shares: --version, --help, the exit codes and the form of a failure.

For every model: `speech info` in text, in JSON equal to the model information of the worker's ready (without the
device and the threads), or for a detection model the worker's refusal, and with --meta, the identity in both as the general keys of --meta give it; `speech devices` in text and JSON; usage errors (exit 2) and a library error
(exit 1, "speech: <code> (<option>): <message>"). For a synthesis model: `speech tts`'s WAVE byte for byte against the
worker's audio of the same lines and seed, into a file, into a regular file through stdout, and appended to a file with
content and through a pipe into cat, where the header cannot be written again in place and keeps its sizes at
0xFFFFFFFF; that nothing but the WAVE reaches stdout and a failed run leaves no file; for Qwen3-TTS a stop at
--max-seconds reported on stderr, and boolean and sampling flags against the worker's members; --instructions against
the worker's member where the model takes it and its refusal where it does not; with --reference a voice file made by
`speech voice` that `speech tts` speaks with; with --embedding one made of a speaker-inversion embedding; on a model
that reads a text in one request, a text of two sentences as the worker's one request of it; and on a model that speaks
a text a sentence at a time (Irodori-TTS), a paragraph of thirty sentences in one request a sentence, whose seed
reported with -v repeats the WAVE byte for byte and which, with --asr a recognition model, is heard within
worker_client.MOST_CER, and a run with no place to cut refused, naming it. For a
recognition model: `speech asr` on WAVE files of the dumps of reference/fastconformer/dump.py or
reference/qwen3-asr/dump.py against the worker's text of the same samples, as text and as JSON with the stop and the
languages, the one qwen-asr parsed or none, and where the model takes timestamps as text with --timestamps one line per
segment and as JSON with them, the segments and tokens the worker's; and for a dump that holds requests with a forced
language and a prompt, or with a decoding other than the default, `speech asr --language --prompt` or `speech asr
--decoding` against the worker's text of the same request, and as JSON its languages; and with --vad a detection model,
`speech asr --vad` on the dumps' audio joined with silences between them against the worker's ends of the regions that
`speech vad --split` writes, each of which holds the samples of its region, joined as transcription by regions joins
them (as JSON, with times where the model takes timestamps), an empty text for a file of silence, and the refusals of a
model of another task for --vad and of a detection option the model does not take. For a detection model: `speech vad`
on 32-bit float WAVE files of the dumps of reference/silero-vad/dump.py against the regions in each dump's
regions.json, the official's, with the flags of each set of options, as text and as JSON; with --split a WAVE file of
each region holding its samples as 16-bit PCM, named so that they sort in order, and the refusals of two files of one
name and of a file named as another's region in the folder, left as it was; and `speech asr` of the detection model with
--vad, refused on a file without speech.
